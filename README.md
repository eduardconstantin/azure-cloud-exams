<h1 align="center">Azure Fundamentals Exam Questions</h1>
<br />

This is a web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, Cosmos DB, GraphQL and Tailwind CSS. The application is a quiz
that tests your knowledge of Azure fundamentals, specifically for the AZ-900 certification exam. The questions are
stored in a Cosmos DB database and retrieved using GraphQL queries. The application is deployed on Microsoft Azure.

This project was created for learning purposes to help me understand Microsoft Azure and Cosmos DB in preparation for
the AZ-900 exam.

Run the app:

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Because I only have a Free Tier account for Cosmos DB, the database won't be available for local development. Instead I
created a json file with some dummy data (the file is located in src/qdb.json).
